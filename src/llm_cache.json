Based on the estimated causal effect of the PhD program on the outcome of being hired at OpenAI, we have a specific finding: the average causal effect is approximately 0.003.\n\nIn plain language, this means that the difference in hiring likelihood between graduates from MIT and Stanford, in terms of their PhD programs, is very small\u2014essentially negligible. The value of 0.003 suggests that choosing one program over the other does not have a meaningful impact on your chances of being hired at OpenAI.\n\nGiven this information, you can conclude that both MIT and Stanford are equally strong options for pursuing a PhD if your primary goal is to increase your chances of getting hired at OpenAI. Other factors, such as your personal interests, the specific research opportunities available, faculty you might want to work with, or the culture of the institution, may be more important considerations in making your decision. \n\nIn summary, based on the estimated causal effect, you should feel confident that either choice is likely to lead to similar outcomes in terms of employment at OpenAI."}
